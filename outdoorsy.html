            <h2>Outdoorsy Case Study</h2>
            <h2>Objective</h2>
            <p>
                This is a responsive web app that uses location to suggest outdoor activities to the user. It will give the user information
                     about the location and activity so that the user is prepared for the activity.
            </p>
            <h2>Hypothesis</h2>
            <p>
                 I believe people want to be able to find an activity outdoors with ease and in a timely manner that meets their needs and wants. 
                By narrowing down activities to the outdoor arena, it will be less overwhelming and intimidating for people to use this product. 
                Suggesting a variety of activities with advanced search results enables users to find an activity that they will enjoy and remember. 
            </p>
            <h2>Overview</h2>
             <p>
                As an outdoor enthusiast, I would love to inspire people to get outside and connect with nature wherever they may be. The app is 
                appropriate for anyone from couch potato to outdoor expert. The app features multiple functionalities appropriate for the user to 
                get the most out of their outdoor experience. The user will be able to feel confident and excited about spending time outdoors no 
                matter what activities they are interested in. This app will provide them with the information needed to be prepared for their adventure.
             </p>
            <h2>Users Can...</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Search for outdoor activities with ease</li>
                <li>Access a map and directions of the area for easy navigation</li>
                <li>Access logistical information for preparedness</li>
                <li>Bookmark places of interest for future reference</li>

            <h2>Competetive Analysis</h2>
            <p>
                I conducted a competitive analysis on <strong>Tripadvisor</strong> and <strong>Foursquare</strong> to gain insight to the direction of my
                design by identifying what works and what doesnâ€™t work with these apps.
            </p>
            <p>
                Using <strong>SWOT</strong> and defining the key objectives, overall strategies, and market advantages a marketing profile and UX analysis
                was defined.

            <h2>Outcomes and Lessons</h2>
             <h3>What went well?</h3>
            <p>Feedback from user interviews really helped me determine preference which were a great starting off point in the design process.
                It helped me prioritize the endless amount of options a designer is faced with and helped me focus on aspects that are the most 
                relevant to the users needs. Testing the wireframes early on in the design process helped me determine difficulties that can be resolved 
                in advance of them becoming bigger issues. 
            </p>
            <strong>Skills:</strong> User reasearch and testing, analytical thinking
            <br>
            <strong>Processes:</strong> User-centered design
            <br>
            <strong>Solution:</strong> Continue to involve users in the design process throughout the project
             <h3>What didn't go well?</h3>
                <p>I struggled with translating the wire-frames into the prototype. I had a couple of iterations for several screens and had a hard time 
                deciding which ones were the best options for the prototype. Some of the ones I picked were not fully thought out or consistent in design.
                When I plugged them into the prototype there were areas that were awkward and I had to make changes in order for the prototype to flow correctly. 
                </p>
                <strong>Skills:</strong> Exploratory sketches, wire-framing, prototyping, rapid ideation
                 <br>
                <strong>Processes:</strong> Crazy 8â€™s, brainstorming
                <br>
                <strong>Skills Gap:</strong> Consistency, focus
                <br>
                <strong>Solutions:</strong> 
                <ul>
                    <li>Watch tutorials on this aspect of the design process</li>
                    <li>Practice various rapid ideation techniques</li>
                    <li>Explore and practice different strategies for brainstorming and sketching</li>
                </ul>
                 <h3>What can be improved?</h3>
                <p>I had some difficulty with determining the MVP and JTBD for the project and putting thoughts into words. As new concepts for me, I struggled with 
                     honing in on the key aspects of the task while trying to grasp the concept. At first everything was very abstract and it took some time for me to gain some focus.
                </p>
                 <strong>Skills:</strong> Gathering requirements, determining JTBD, and defining an MVP
                <br>
                <strong>Processes:</strong> JTBD structure and MVP development
                <br>
                <strong>Skills Gap:</strong> Communication, organization of thoughts
                <br>
                <strong>Solutions:</strong> 
                <ul>

                    <li>Study examples</li>
